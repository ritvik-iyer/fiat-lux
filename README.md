# Fiat-Lux
The Latin phrase "fiat lux" translates to "let there be light." In our increasingly digitized world, we must be wary about the news sources from which we consume information. As such, we aim to bring light to the underlying political advocacy and messaging within the news articles we read everyday. We aim to create a text classifier that is able to predict the media outlet which wrote a particular news articles.  

### 10/13 
We filtered the data from [FakeNewsCorpus](https://github.com/several27/FakeNewsCorpus) to only include articles that were political or news-media orientated. We began the data cleaning process.
